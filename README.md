## a. Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early and accurate detection can save lives. This project builds and compares multiple machine learning classification models to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease, based on clinical and demographic features.

The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of six different classification algorithms on the same dataset using standard evaluation metrics, and deploy the best-performing pipeline as an interactive web application.

### Observations on Model Performance

| ML Model Name | Observation about Model Performance |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression | Achieved a solid baseline accuracy of 85.3% with an impressive AUC of 0.92, indicating good class separability. The model benefits from the near-linear relationships between features like Age, MaxHR, and Oldpeak with the target. It is fast, interpretable, and a reliable baseline. Slightly limited by its linearity assumption. |
| Decision Tree | Performed the weakest among all models with 81.5% accuracy and AUC of 0.81, showing signs of overfitting. Decision trees tend to memorize training patterns and do not generalize as well to test data. Lacks the regularization needed for this dataset without pruning or depth constraints. |
| K-Nearest Neighbor | Performed well with 86.9% accuracy and 0.93 AUC, benefiting from the scaled features. KNN is a non-parametric model that works well when class boundaries are irregular. However, it may be sensitive to noisy features and is computationally expensive at inference time. |
| Naive Bayes | Achieved 84.8% accuracy with an AUC of 0.92. While it assumes feature independence (violated in medical data), the Gaussian NB still performed competitively. It's extremely fast and works surprisingly well as a probabilistic baseline despite the independence assumption being unrealistic. |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) | One of the top performers with 88.6% accuracy and 0.95 AUC. As a bagging ensemble, it reduces variance by averaging across many decision trees, resulting in robust and generalizable predictions. Feature importance analysis shows MaxHR, Oldpeak, and ST_Slope as the most predictive features. |
| XGBoost (Ensemble) | Delivered the best overall performance — 90.2% accuracy, 0.96 AUC, and 0.80 MCC. As a boosting ensemble, it iteratively corrects errors from previous trees. Its gradient-boosted approach handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions very effectively, making it ideal for tabular clinical data like this dataset. |

## 📌 Key Takeaways

1. **Ensemble methods (XGBoost, Random Forest) consistently outperform** single models on structured/tabular data.
2. **Logistic Regression and KNN** are strong baselines with good AUC scores.
3. **Decision Tree** without regularization overfits; bagging (Random Forest) corrects this.
4. **Naive Bayes** is competitive despite its independence assumption – useful when speed matters.
5. The **MCC score** is more informative than accuracy for imbalanced datasets, confirming XGBoost's superiority.
